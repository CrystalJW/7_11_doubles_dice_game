# 7_11_doubles_dice_game
The game is called 7/11/doubles and it is written in Python. The player has two dice. When they roll the dice, they earn 20 points by rolling 7, 11, or doubles (when the two dice have the same number. Example: "2" and "2"). Otherwise, they lose 10 points. Once they reach at least 100 points, they win and the game ends.
